# 1-3. Conditionals and Control Flow

Today we learn how to tell the computer to make decisions and comparisons. This allows us to give complicated sets of instructions that can change depending on the input.

## Outline

1. Comparisons, (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
2. Logical operators(`and`, `or`, `not`) 
3. Conditionals (`If`/`else`, `elif`, indents, formatting)
4. How Python treats non-Booleans

## 1. Comparisons, (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)

The four basic comparisons take in two numbers (`int` or `float`, you can mix them) and outputs the Boolean `True` or `False`.

code | words
---|---
`<` | less than
`<=`| less than or equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=`| greater than or equal to

For example

```python
print(6 > 5, 6 >= 5, 6 < 5, 5 <= 5)
>>>> True True False True
```

We already use `=` for variable assignment, so we use `==` for equality and `!=` for not equal. Objects of different types, but with the same value are considered equal, e.g. `1 == 1.0`.

code | words
---|---
`==` | equal
`!=`| not equal

```python
print(6 == 5, 5 == 10/2, 6 != 5, 5 != 10/2)
>>>> False True True False
```

Be careful when comparing `float`s as numerical imprecision might make Python believe things are not equal when in fact they should be.

```python
import math
pi = math.pi
print(math.tan(pi/4), 1, math.tan(pi/4) == 1)
>>>> 0.9999999999999999 1 False 
```

2. Logical operators(`and`, `or`, `not`)

We can combine simple statements to make more complicated expressions by connecting statements with logical operators:

operator | output
---|---
`x and y` | `True` only when both `x` and `y` are `True`
`x or y` | `True` as long as at least one of `x` or `y` are `True`
`not x` | `True` if `x` is `False`, and `False` if `x` is `True`

For example:

```python
x = 6 > 5
y = 5 > 9
z = 2 < 0
print( x and y, x or y, not z)
>>>> False True True
```

Things get more complicated when we chain together logical operators. We could spend a long time discussing combinations of logical operators, but here we'll only mention the basics. Operations are performed in the following order:

1. `not`
2. `and`
3. `or`

For example:

```python
x = 6 > 5
y = 5 > 9
z = 2 < 0

print( x and y or x and not z)
>>>> True
```

## 4. How Python treats non-Booleans

When using `if` statements, Python is very flexible. You can pass strings or numbers to the `if` statement, not just Booleans. A number is evaluated as `False` if it is `0`, and it is `True` otherwise. A string is evaluated as `False` if it is the empty string, and `True` otherwise.

This allows for more readable code and allows us to shorten statements like `if x == True:` to `if x:`. 

For example:

```python
count = 2
count -= 1
count -= 1

if count:
	# we can divide by 0
	print(10/count)
else:
	# count is 0
	print("We can't divide by 0.")
>>>> We can't divide by 0.
```
